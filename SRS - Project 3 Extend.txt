Project: Hotel Room Booking System

Calculate the cost based on 
	the number of nights and 
	room type for hotel room bookings.

BR001: $100 per night for standard rooms.
BR002: $150 per night for deluxe rooms.
BR003: $200 per night for suites.

Apply discounts based on the length of stay:

BR004: 10% discount for bookings of 3 or more consecutive nights.
BR005: 15% discount for bookings of 7 or more consecutive nights.
BR006: No additional discounts for bookings of fewer than 3 nights.
BR007: Max 30 Night

Determine the total cost by multiplying the base price per night with the 
number of nights and applying any applicable discounts.

FR001 : System display error if user enter invalid data in Room selection. 
FR002 : System display error if user enter more then 30 night. 

TR001 : System only accept numeric value. 

New Feature Requirement:

FR003: Allow users to choose optional add-ons during the booking process, such as breakfast, 
	airport shuttle, or spa services. Each add-on has a specific cost associated with it.
	
AO001: Breakfast - $20 per day.
AO002: Airport Shuttle - $30 per trip.
AO003: Spa Services - $50 per day.


Additional Conditions for the New Feature:

AO004: If a user books a suite for more than 5 consecutive nights and adds spa services, 
	they get a 20% discount on the total cost of spa services.
AO005: Users can only book airport shuttle services if their stay is 3 or more consecutive nights.
AO006: If a user books a deluxe room for more than 3 consecutive nights and 
	adds breakfast, they get a 10% discount on the total cost of breakfast.
	
Integration with Total Cost Calculation:
TC003: Integrate the optional add-ons into the total cost calculation.
 
The total cost now includes the base price for the room, 
any applicable length-of-stay discounts, and the cost of selected add-ons.

This new feature enhances the Hotel Room Booking System by providing users 
with the flexibility to customize their stay with optional add-ons, 
making their experience more tailored to their preferences.
